# Assignment#4 Puzzle_Code

The code of puzzles are placed respectively in the "breakout" and "mathquiz" folders.

1.Break Out Game
<br>I followed the steps in this tutorial:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript 
<br>Css style reference: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp
<br>Useful color website: https://uigradients.com/#OrangeCoral
<br>The code may look a little messy because I wrote many notes beside the code to remind myself  >.<
<br>Just ignore the " breakoutMessy.html " file~



2.Math Quiz
<br>The tutorial was found on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9h2RF-TCPI
<br>Problem: There is a render problem that the font style cannot be rendered in Chrome. Actually the problem occurred in "Breake Out Game" but I fixed it by adding &nbsp;&nbsp;type="text/css"&nbsp;&nbsp; in &nbsp;&nbsp;link&nbsp;&nbsp; element. However, it did not work in "Math Quiz"...
