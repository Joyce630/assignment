<br><br>Introduction:
<br>I used the tool in "https://www.datawrapper.de/maps/" to create the metrics, and embedded them in the webpage. Only the "Province|省份" map in the "Destination" webpage used rollup data. Some drawbacks of the maps: (1) Except the "Province|省份" map, other maps cannot zoom in/zoom out.(I did not find the zoom in/zoom out function in this kind of map.) (2)In the "Province|省份" map, the order of legend (it's on the top right) could not be customized. It would look better, if sorted by the number of destinations.
