<br><b>Introduction</b>
<br>I used a template on startbootstrap.com as a basic template for my website. A lot of changes were made in the css style, and also a map and a bar chart were embedded.


<br><b>Source data</b>
<li>Map-Destination information:https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invXuTgar6Wj3Eglp&inviteToken=13deb5959d2f530f0498b0ccb71a5e236200fa76c9f1f01086a5a0016355f3b5
<li>Map-Italy GeoJSON(I didn't use all geojson in the final web because it is too much and only the data of related provinces were kept): https://github.com/openpolis/geojson-italy/blob/master/geojson/limits_IT_provinces.geojson
<li>Bar chart: https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invjb7aCmr9H31NUl&inviteToken=984f5b442f174cb7f335423f336bc5721b3f540e073b999bf8c55ffc99b83556
